				Welcome to my mini portfolio website. My name is Anitha. I live in Durham NH. I am passionate about pottery and i'm a creative thinker.  Designing has always been my favourite, I thoroughly enjoy doing so. One of my dreams is to become a web designer and I like to design websites. So, now I am working toward it to achieve my goal.</p>

			<p id="para"> For two year's I have learnt pottery at "Red Door pottery" studio in Maine. I have five year's of experience in this field. I have a few of handmade pottery pieces. Please feel free to take a look at my portfolio for my pottery pictures.
